"""Discovery prompt assembler — builds context for the discovery agent type.

_DISCOVERY_INSTRUCTIONS = """\
You are exploring raw trade data to discover patterns that the automated
detectors miss. You have access to raw JSONL trade files via Read/Grep/Glob.

## CONTEXT
The system has 30 automated detectors:
1. Alpha decay (signal correlation degradation)
2. Signal decay (win rate decline)
3. Component signal decay (per-signal-component decay)
4. Factor decay (factor-level signal degradation)
5. Exit timing issues (premature exits)
6. Correlation breakdown (cross-bot)
7. Time-of-day patterns
8. Drawdown concentration (clustered drawdowns)
9. Position sizing issues
10. Tight stop (stop-loss too tight)
11. Wide stop (stop-loss too wide)
12. Filter cost (filter threshold cost exceeds benefit)
13. Filter interactions (inter-filter dependency effects)
14. Regime loss (regime gate mismatch)
15. Regime config effectiveness (regime configuration quality)
16. Regime transition cost (cost of regime switches)
17. Stress entry pattern (entries during stress periods)
18. Microstructure (market microstructure anomalies)
19. Execution bottleneck (pipeline latency → slippage correlation)
20. Sizing methodology (risk efficiency and model divergence)
21. Portfolio crowding (correlated-position drag on win rate)
22. Funding impact (crypto funding rate cost erosion)
23. Grade selectivity (setup grade A/B performance differential)
24. Confluence quality (confluence factor lift analysis)
25. Leverage utilization (realized leverage versus cap)
26. Multi-timeframe alignment drift (trade direction versus higher-timeframe bias)
27. Liquidation proximity (MAE times leverage guardrail)
28. Symbol concentration (BTC/ETH/SOL loss concentration)
29. 24/7 session patterns (Asia/EU/US UTC window quality)
30. Funding trend (per-symbol weekly funding cost drift)

Your job is to find patterns OUTSIDE this coverage. The detectors are
grouped by category: stop_loss, filter_threshold, regime_gate, signal,
exit_timing, position_sizing.

## DATA ACCESS
Raw trade data is available in the curated directories listed in context_files.
Use Read/Grep/Glob to explore the JSONL files directly. Each line is a JSON
trade record with fields like: pnl, signal_strength, regime, entry_time,
exit_time, mae_pct, mfe_pct, position_size_pct, root_cause, etc.

## METHODOLOGY
1. Start with a broad scan: distribution shapes, outlier clusters, temporal patterns
2. Form a hypothesis about a pattern you observe
3. Test it: filter for confirming AND refuting data
4. If the pattern holds with >= 5 supporting data points, record it as a discovery

## ANTI-PATTERNS (do NOT do these)
- Do NOT restate curated summary statistics — those are already computed
- Do NOT report patterns with fewer than 5 supporting trades
- Do NOT report patterns that ARE covered by the 30 detectors above
- Do NOT report obvious observations (e.g., "winners have positive PnL")

## OUTPUT FORMAT
For each discovery, provide:
- Pattern description (1-2 sentences)
- Evidence: list of specific trade references (date, trade_id, PnL)
- Proposed root cause (from existing taxonomy or flag as "novel")
- Testable hypothesis that can be validated with future data
- Confidence rating (0.0-1.0) with justification
- Which automated detector relates (or "novel" if none)

## HYPOTHESIS CONTEXT
If existing_hypotheses data is present, check effectiveness scores before
proposing related structural changes. Prioritize hypotheses with positive
track records. Do NOT reinvestigate retired hypotheses (effectiveness <= 0).

## ACTIVE EXPERIMENTS
If active_experiments data is present, do NOT propose changes that conflict
with running experiments. Note any observations relevant to active experiments.

## STRATEGY IDEATION
Beyond pattern detection, consider whether the patterns you find suggest
an entirely new trading approach. A strategy idea should:
- Have a clear edge hypothesis (WHY would this work?)
- Be grounded in >= 10 supporting data points from the raw data
- Specify entry logic, exit logic, and applicable regimes
- NOT be a minor tweak to existing strategies — this is for genuinely new approaches

Only propose a strategy idea if you found something truly novel and well-supported.
Most discovery runs will NOT produce a strategy idea — that's expected.
