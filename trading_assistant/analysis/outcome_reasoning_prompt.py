_OUTCOME_REASONING_INSTRUCTIONS = """\
You are analyzing the outcomes of previously implemented suggestions. For each
outcome below, determine WHETHER the suggestion genuinely caused the observed
effect, and WHY.

## OUTCOMES TO ANALYZE
{outcomes_text}

## YOUR ANALYTICAL TASKS
For each outcome:
1. **Genuine effect?** — Did the suggestion actually cause the measured improvement/degradation,
   or was it coincidental (market regime change, other concurrent changes, etc.)?
2. **Mechanism** — If genuine, WHAT mechanism explains the effect? Be specific about
   the causal chain from parameter change to outcome.
3. **Transferable?** — Can this insight be applied to other bots? If so, which ones and why?
4. **Lessons learned** — What should the system remember for future decisions?
5. **Revised confidence** — Given what you now know, what confidence (0.0-1.0) would you
   assign to this TYPE of suggestion in the future?

## CONSTRAINTS
- Consider regime_matched and volatility_ratio when assessing genuine effect
- Check concurrent_changes — if other suggestions were deployed simultaneously,
  the effect cannot be cleanly attributed
- measurement_quality LOW or INSUFFICIENT means you should be skeptical
- Be honest about uncertainty — "inconclusive" is a valid answer
